Users could understand the underlying bins (genomes) of the microbes in their metagenomes by simply providing assembled metagenomic sequences and the reads coverage information or sequencing reads. For users' convenience MaxBin will report genome-related statistics, including estimated completeness, GC content and genome size in the binning summary page. Users could use MEGAN or similar software on MaxBin bins to find out the taxonomy of each bin after the binning process is finished.\r\n\r\nThe most current version is 2.2.7.\r\n\r\nMaxBin was published on Microbiome journal (2:26)!
